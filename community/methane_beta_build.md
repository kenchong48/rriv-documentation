# RRIV Methane Beta Setup
## Overview
Beta version RRIV loggers with methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Methane sensors use a Figaro XXX metal oxide sensor and CO<sub>2</sub> sensors use a Atlas Scientific infrared carbon dioxide sensor. Sensors were encased in segments of 2" PVC pipe with one end covered by a XXX" thick PTFE diaphragm to permit gas exchange with the water.

## Included components
* RRIV Data Logger (V0.21)
* Enclosed CH<sub>4</sub> sensor
* Enclosed CO<sub>2</sub> sensor
* ABS sonde housing (add link to instructions on how to build one yourself)

## Off the shelf components to purchase
* Hex nuts (part number; url to purchase)
* Washers (part number; url to purchase)
* Threaded rod XX" (part number; url to purchase)

## Sensor assembly
* place bolts through the solid acrylic plate that forms the back of the sonde and fix washers and nuts on the short side acrylic plate to holid it in place. (would be good to have a picture of the different steps sooner or later!)

## Initial sensor setup and configuration
* Load VS Code or install CLI
* Plug in sensor
* use following configuration commands: set-config<>
* test sensor performance using the command start-logging
